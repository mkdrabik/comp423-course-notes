These packages are a way to group functions and contain all files in the same directory. The main function in the main package is the starting point of our program. We imported the popular \"fmt\" package which contains functions for formatting text, including printing to the console. This package is one of the standard library packages that were installed when Go was installed. We are not limited to importing just \"fmt\" to import another package simply add <code>import &lt;package name&gt;</code> below previous imports.</p> <p>Step 3: Run your program.</p> <p> Running a program in Go </p> <p>In Go, there are two different ways to run your program <code>go run</code> and <code>go build</code>. The difference between the two is that <code>go run</code> compiles your code into a temporary executable which it then runs and deletes after it is done executing. This is ideal for quick testing. However, <code>go build</code> creates an executable binary file of your code, which is then saved to your current directory. You can then run by typing <code>./&lt;name of file&gt;</code> in the terminal. Using this command is more ideal for producing binaries for later use or distribution. </p> <p>Go run: To run your program type the following into your terminal. This should print \"Hello COMP 423\" to your terminal.</p> <pre><code>go run main.go\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"tutorials/go-setup/#_9","title":"Setting up a dev container for Go","text":"<p>Go build: In order to run <code>go build</code> we must first add a new file to our directory. </p> <p><pre><code>go mod init my-go-project\n</code></pre> This creates a go.mod file which manages the dependencies you are using.
